Rewrite the script for Wordpress 3.5.2 + Wordpress LaTeX Plugin 3.4.6
------

- [ ] need to modify css file, for blockquote tag.
- [ ] for most cases, the script can transfer the tex code into html which works well under the Wordpress LaTeX plugin 3.4.6.
- [x] sample css snippet will be added.
- [x] cannot process \ref and \cite. Have problem with alignment also.
- [x] not robust on detecting errors, need some pre-static-analyzing.
- [ ] sample page http://minfun.info

Thanks.
